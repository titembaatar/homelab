# üèóÔ∏è Software Stack Overview

## Layered Architecture
The homelab employs a layered approach to virtualization, orchestration, and service delivery:

1.  **Hardware Layer:**
    * Consists of 3x Mini PCs (`Mukhulai`, `Borchi`, `Borokhul`) acting as hypervisors, 1x NAS (`Borte`) for backups, and supporting network gear (Switch, Router).
    * *Reference: See [Hardware Overview](./hardware.md) for detailed specs.*

2.  **Virtualization Layer:**
    * **Proxmox VE Cluster:** Installed across the 3 Mini PCs, providing HA for VMs.

3.  **Operating System Layer (VMs):**
    * **Debian GNU:** These are provisioned from a standardized VM template.

4.  **Container Orchestration Layer:**
    * **Docker Swarm:** Deployed across 6 VMs (3 Managers `Subeedei`, `Zev`, `Khubilai` & 3 Workers `Uriankhai`, `Besud`, `Baarin`). Docker Swarm manages container deployment, scaling, networking, secrets, and service discovery across the Proxmox cluster nodes.

5.  **Storage Layer:**
    * **NFS Server:** Provided by Proxmox host `Mukhulai`.
    * **Docker NFS Volumes:** Swarm nodes dynamically mount required NFS shares using Docker's built-in `local` volume driver with NFS options. Containers access persistent configuration and data via these Docker-managed volumes.
    * **Backup Storage:** NFS/SMB share on `Borte` used as a target for Proxmox VM backups and ZFS snapshot replication.

## Key Component Roles Summary
* **Proxmox VE:** Manages VMs and provides hardware abstraction & HA.
* **Docker Swarm:** Manages container lifecycle, networking, and secrets across the cluster.
* **NFS:** Provides centralized, persistent storage accessible across the cluster.
* **Cloudflare Tunnel + Caddy:** Provide secure, HTTPS-enabled access to internal services from the internet.
* **TinyAuth + CrowdSec:** Secure access to applications through authentication and intrusion prevention.
* **Pi-hole:** Simplifies network access through local DNS name resolution and blocks ads.
