# DISCLAIMER
# All credits to `NorkzYT` on github for this script !
# Original script at : https://gist.github.com/NorkzYT/14449b247dae9ac81ba4664564669299
# This is a slightly modified version for my needs.

# This script is designed to assist in mounting CIFS/SMB shares to a Proxmox LXC container.
# It automates the process of creating a mount point on the Proxmox VE (PVE) host, adding the
# CIFS share to the /etc/fstab for persistent mounts, and configuring the LXC container to
# recognize the share. This script is intended for use on a Proxmox Virtual Environment and
# requires an LXC container to be specified that will access the mounted share.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Proxmox Virtual Environment setup.
# - An LXC container already created and running on Proxmox.
# - CIFS/SMB share details (hostname/IP, share name, SMB username, and password).
# - Root privileges on the Proxmox host.
#
# How to Use:
# 1. Ensure the target LXC container is running before executing this script.
# 2. Run this script as root or with sudo privileges.
# 3. Follow the prompts to enter the required information for the CIFS/SMB share
#    and the LXC container details.
#
# Note: This script must be run as root to modify system files and perform mount operations.

# Ensure the script is run as root
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
   echo "This script must be run as root"
